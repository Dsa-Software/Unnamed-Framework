## Concept
This framework is a personal project, I had the idea when I seen that [Dsa Software Foundation](https://github.com/Dsa-Software)'s projects, company that I'm CEO, were extremely unorganized. This Framework comes to make easier the life of Programming, Design and Business projects, from the concept to the end.

# Stage 1

The concept of the project is one of the most important stages, seeing that you need to know what you are doing and why are you doing that. Writing a few ideas is a good practice.

# Stage 2

Preparing the infrastructure is another essencial stage befora the project. This practice ensure that you are not going to have problemns with Libs, softwares or the OS in the time of the work.

# Stage 3

More then the infra, doing is the main project of the project, because that is so important to take care about what are you making and how are you making

# Stage 4

After doing is good to review the project, a basic concept of all projects of any kind. Applying a Design Patterns will makes better the maintenance and the performance.

If the project is done, building is the next step. Building turns the project usable for all publics you needs and turns better the utilization in any OS.
