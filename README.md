# Unnamed-Framework
A framework to organize I.T. projects

## Concept
This framework is a personal project, I had the idea when I seen that [Dsa Software Foundation](https://github.com/Dsa-Software)'s projects, company that I'm CEO, were extremely unorganized. This Framework comes to make easier the life of Programming, Design and Business projects, from the concept to the end.
