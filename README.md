# Unnamed Framework
A framework to organize I.T. projects

## Concept
This framework is a personal project, I had the idea when I seen that [Dsa Software Foundation](https://github.com/Dsa-Software)'s projects, company that I'm CEO, were extremely unorganized. This Framework comes to make easier the life of Programming, Design and Business projects, from the concept to the end.

## Name
We are acepting names, if you have a good idea ;)

## Stage 1

The concept of the project is one of the most important stages, seeing that you need to know what you are doing and why are you doing that. Writing a few ideas is a good practice.

## Stage 2

Preparing the infrastructure is another essencial stage befora the project. This practice ensure that you are not going to have problemns with Libs, softwares or the OS in the time of the work.
